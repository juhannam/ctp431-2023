# Homework #1: Making Music from Zero Using Python (Due Sep 24)

### Instruction
The goal of this homework is to create a music piece using basic sound synthesis units (oscillators, filters, and envelopes) without any audio samples. The length of the song should be around 10 seconds.  

### Deliverable 
You should submit the source code (.ipynb) and audio file (.wav) via KLMS.

## Step #1: Make your own rhythm track (30pts)
Modify the parameters of sound synthesis units in the <a href="https://github.com/juhannam/ctp431-2023/blob/main/python/03.%20Drum%20Machine.ipynb"> drum machine notebook </a>
- Timbre of kick snare, and hi-hat: amp envelope, lowpass filter
- Pattern of rhythm sequeces
- Tempo 
- Anything else (e.g., change the relative volume of each drum event) 

## Step #2: Make your own melody tone (40pts)
Modify the parameters of sound synthesis units in the <a href="https://github.com/juhannam/ctp431-2023/blob/main/python/02.%20Basic%20Sound%20Synthesis%20Units.ipynb"> basic sound synthesis units notebook </a>
- Oscillator: oscillator type, the number of oscillators with detune
- Filters: filter type, filer envelope (issue: the filter cut-off frequency should be adjusted by the oscillator frequency?)
- Amp: amplitude envelope
- Anything else (e.g., vibrato)

## Step #3: Make your own melody line and mix it with your rhythm track  (30pts)
- You may use other instuments (e.g., piano or guitar) while composing the melody 
- Adjust the mixing gains of the melody and rhythm tracks 

## Options (extra 10 pts)
- You can add more tracks such as bass and chords
